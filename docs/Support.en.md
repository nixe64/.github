## Support

### How to get help

My projects use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please **search the existing issues** before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new Issue.

For help and questions about using one of my projects, please use the [Stack Overflow Questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/) first.

### Support Policy

The technical support for the software in my repositories is only possible to a very limited extent. This is free software and for this reason the [license agreement](Copyright.en.md) already states:

The software under this License is distributed on an **"AS IS"** basis.
