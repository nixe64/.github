## Support

### How to get help

My projects use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please **search the existing issues** before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new Issue.

For help and questions about using one of my projects, please use the [Stack Overflow Questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/) first.
