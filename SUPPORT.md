### How to get help

My projects use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new Issue.

For help and questions about using one of my projects, please use the [Stack Overflow Questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/) first.
